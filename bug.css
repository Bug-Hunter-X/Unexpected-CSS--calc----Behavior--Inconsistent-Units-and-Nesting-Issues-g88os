The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results when dealing with percentages and units inconsistently. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 10);` might not, because the units are implied in the percentage, but not explicitly stated for the pixel value.  Another issue arises when nesting `calc()` functions, leading to complex parsing and potential errors if the order of operations isn't carefully considered.
