To correct the `calc()` function issues, always specify units explicitly for all values within the calculation, even when percentages are used. For nested `calc()` functions, ensure the order of operations is clear and that units are consistent across the nested calculations. For example, rewrite `width: calc(50% - 10);` as `width: calc(50% - 10px);` and ensure nested `calc()` calls maintain unit consistency.
